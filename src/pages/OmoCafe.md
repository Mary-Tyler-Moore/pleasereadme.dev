## Motivation: :running: :dash:

:earth_africa: **_Omo Hope Cafe_** :coffee: aims to financially support Omo Hope, and raise awareness of the awesome work Omo Hope is doing in Southern Ethiopia. For the last decade, Omo Hope has worked unremittingly to provide a safe, nurturing home and quality education for rescued Mingi children living in the remote Omo Valley region of Southwest Ethiopia. Mingi is the ritualistic killing of infants and children believed to be cursed.

# omo-hope-cafe

Amharic / English Quasar Project I'm building for a NGO in Southern Ethiopia :earth_africa:

## Amharic:

> Amharic is one of my favorite languages to work with. Amharic was the first non-romance language that I learned to translate and write.

## Special Thanks:

> Thanks to the help of our full-time nannies, Omo Hope is able to care for children in need!
